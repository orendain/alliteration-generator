He stole "the pan"
"some pans"
"some cookies"

Some determiners can be used with both mass/count nouns:
"some"
"a lot (of)"
"no"

"few"/"many" for count nouns
"little"/"much" for mass nouns

[possessive -s]
[the guy with the hat]'s dog
[the cute girl with feet]'s scarf


Terms:
MassNoun
{ CountNoun (chair/chairs)
{ ProperNouns (aka CommonNoun) (regular nouns)
ProperNames =
  Usually not preceded by determiners


PropNoun = Africa & Peter
PropName = South Africa & Peter the Great

ProperNames normally cannot have articles/determiners

extra determiners: any/another

"beaten by" = VP
"The <> having been killed by" = VP

  Verb + "-ed"



RelativeClause:
  NonRestrictive and Restrictive
  The woman, who had a thick French accent, was very pretty." (non-restrictive — does not narrow down who is being talked about)
  The woman who had the thick French accent was very pretty." (restrictive — adds information about who is being referred to)



Add support for antecededents, anaphoras, coreference

Dangling modifiers
  or just VP + VP "she (ate the burger) (jumping with joy)"
  "He hit the rat, the trees were beautiful" [ugh, maybe not]
  "He hit the rat, swimming in the ocean" [ugh, maybe not]

VP [and] VP

Good example of active/passive and present/perfect:

Negative Inversion - "john jumped on [no] bed"
  at no time, sam will relax
  he fled from no country

Standard SV-clauses (subject-verb) are the norm in English. They are usually declarative (as opposed to exclamative, imperative, or interrogative)



Light Verb (aka delexical, vector, explicator, thin, semantically weak verb):
do, give, have, make, take

(^^ these can all be followed by "the" or "a" or quantifiers, but not at/with)
  (the/a/quantifiers = determiners)

I believe all light verbs can be followed (only) by a determiner


Idea:
Drop in verbs into possible structures and have users vote to see if it makes sense.

Ex: drop in "revises" into this otherwise obviously sensible sentence.
"Edgar REVISES at the wall."
Does this sentence make sense to you? Yes/No
